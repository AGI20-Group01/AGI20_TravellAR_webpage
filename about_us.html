        <p>My focus in this project was to create the backend and the interactions via the server. The difficulty with that was to make a backend that works well for the game but does not require that much backend code. I had not used socket.io before this course so learned a lot about socket.io. I also had a focus on writing shaders, which I had never done before. The hardest part about it was finding good documentation and examples, but I learned a lot about shader writing during the course. I also did some 3d modeling, which I had done a bit before, but I feel that I have gotten better at it during the course. Finally, I did some game programming (managing blocks in the world) and UI.</p>

        <p>My main focus in this project has been animating and rigging the models. This was a big challenge since I’ve never used Blender before. I also worked on exporting and implementing the animated models in Unity, where I further worked on implementing the animations. Additionally, I worked on the character controller for the Traveller model, where I implemented the first version of the controller which was steered by keyboard, and then parts of the existing navmesh. Finally, I also implemented sound effects and background music, worked on the game design and the concept art. I believe my main challenge in this project was to work in Blender and Unity, since I had almost no previous experience in them. However, I found the project very fun and educative since I learned a lot about Unity and Blender, as well as more on how to structure the code so it’s easier to go back and change concepts at a later stage.</p>

        <p>In this project I have mainly focused on player interactions and particle effects. I worked on  creating the interactions for the spirit-player, translating all interactions for the traveller-player to touch input, contributed some to the navmesh controlling as well as the placement of the AR world, and created all particle effects. I also worked on the game design and the concept art, and handled most of our video editing. Having never really worked with AR was probably my biggest challenge, as well as figuring out intuitive and well functioning touch screen interactions. Since we only worked with touch input and did not want buttons, we had to figure out good ways to distinguish between different types of touch input and make it work really well. I already had some experience working in Unity, but it was a really fun project to get further experience in working with it.</p>
